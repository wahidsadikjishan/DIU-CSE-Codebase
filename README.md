# Welcome to DIU-CSE-Codebase
DIU-CSE-Codebase is a repository of code samples and projects for Computer Science Engineering courses at Daffodil International University (DIU). This repository is intended to provide DIU CSE students with a comprehensive collection of code resources related to their courses, which they can use as a reference, learning tool, or starting point for their own projects.

The DIU-CSE-Codebase is organized by course and topic, covering the core concepts and programming languages taught in the undergraduate CSE program at DIU. It includes code samples and projects for courses such as:
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Database Systems
- Computer Networks
- Operating Systems
- and more
## Our Goal
Our goal is to provide a collaborative and open-source platform for DIU CSE students to share and learn from each otherâ€™s code. Whether you are looking to brush up on a particular programming language, explore a new concept, or get inspired for your next project, we hope you will find something useful in this repository.
## Contributing
We welcome contributions from DIU CSE students and alumni, as well as anyone interested in learning and sharing code related to computer science and engineering. Please feel free to fork this repository, add your own code samples and projects, and make pull requests to share your contributions with the DIU CSE community.
Happy coding!
